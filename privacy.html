    <h1>Privacy Policy for Handwash Tracker</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 16, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when You use the Handwash Tracker application (the "App"). We use Your data to provide and improve the App. By using the App, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>1. Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
        <p>The core functionality of the Handwash Tracker app is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect and store the following information directly and exclusively on your device's local storage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Employee Information:</strong> Employee number, name, and department as entered by the administrator.</li>
            <li><strong>Handwash Logs:</strong> The date, time, and employee number for each handwash performed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This information is never transmitted, shared, or uploaded to any server. It remains private on the device where it was entered.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>2. Third-Party Services: Advertising</h2>
        <p>The free version of Handwash Tracker is supported by advertisements provided by Google AdMob, a third-party service. To provide relevant advertising, Google AdMob collects certain data from your device. </p>
        <p>By using the free version of the App, you consent to the collection and sharing of the following data types by our advertising partner (Google) for the purposes of advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location (Approximate):</strong> Your general location may be inferred from your IP address to show ads relevant to your region.</li>
            <li><strong>App Interactions:</strong> Information about how you interact with ads shown in the app (e.g., clicks).</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Information related to the performance of the ads, such as crash logs or latency.</li>
            <li><strong>Device or other IDs:</strong> The Android Advertising ID, which is used for personalized advertising.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data collected by Google AdMob is encrypted in transit. The Pro version of the App does not contain any advertising and does not use this service. For more information on how Google uses data, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google's Privacy & Terms site</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. Camera Usage for Motion Detection</h2>
        <p>The App requests permission to use the device's camera for one specific purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> To confirm that a user is present at the end of the handwashing timer, the app uses the camera to detect motion. <strong>No pictures or videos are ever recorded, stored, or transmitted by the app.</strong> The camera feed is processed in real-time for motion and then immediately discarded. This feature is used solely to ensure the handwashing process is completed correctly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored within the app on your device. However, no electronic storage method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
